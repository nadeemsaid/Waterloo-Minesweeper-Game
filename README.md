# Waterloo-Minesweeper-Game

This project was inspired by the Google Minesweeper Game and was created for the ECE 150 (Fundamentals of Programming) course at the University of Waterloo. The game is personalized to fit the environment at the heart of the University of Waterloo Campus. The campus is known to be flooded with geese that may attack people at any time. This single-player game, asks the user to choose the dimensions of a playing board which is then displayed to the console by asterisks. The user is then queried for how many geese should be spread randomly on the board. Every asterisk '*' represents a location on the board, some locations contain geese, however all locations are initially hidden. The user is then given options to ( [S]how; [M]ark; [R]estart; [Q]uit ) a location. When the user reveals a location by entering [S], the number of geese directly adjacent (in any direction) to that location replaces the asterisk on the board. The game terminates if a user "disturbs a goose" or reveals a location where a goose is sitting. The user wins the game if all the locations are revealed, except for those containing geese. The [M] option allows the user to mark a hidden location without revealing it. This option helps the user identify potential geese locations before winning/losing the game.
